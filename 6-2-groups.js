/* 
The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure called Set. Like an instance of Map, 
a set holds a collection of values. Unlike Map, it does not associate other values with those—it just tracks 
which values are part of the set. A value can be part of a set only once—adding it again doesn’t have any effect.

Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. 
Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds a value to the group (but only if it isn’t already a member), 
delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean value indicating whether 
its argument is a member of the group.
Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, to determine whether two values are the same.

Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as argument and creates a group that 
contains all the values produced by iterating over it.
